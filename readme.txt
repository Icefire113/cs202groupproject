Code was written in an Ubuntu environment, 
in order to run you must ensure that you have mvn installed with the latest version of java, compilation and building can be accomplished by running build.sh,
or by opening the directory with build.sh and running "mvn package" followed by "mvn exec:java".

if you would Like to run this program in windows you may encounter issues displaying unicode characters in your windows terminal, this is because windows hates you and you will either have to enable it in your
terminal or install a custom terminal that allows it or just give up and run the compatibility version we made for windows which looks like pig vomit. 


if you have issues compiling please contact us because I dont want to lose credit over something stupid.



also this doesnt need to be specifiued because of the way open source licenses work but StdAudio.java is being used under an Open Source License
